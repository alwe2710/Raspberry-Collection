# Raspberry-Collection
This collection of programmes was mainly made for the Wii U Gamepad Raspberry Pi project(combined with Teensy 2 or Teensy 2++). All components can be used for different prjects as well<br>
To use the Tennsy in the Arduino IDE follow this guide: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html<br>
Teensy can be simply connected to Raspberry Pi via USB, for that you have to set 'USB Type' to 'Serial'( + Keyboard + Mouse + Joystick, if you want to use it as gamepad as well)<br>
